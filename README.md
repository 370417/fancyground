- Highlight entire squares instead of drawing circles
- Customize arrow and highlight colors
- Arrows no longer cover the pieces that they originate from

## Drawing arrows with different colors

On Lichess, right click and drag to draw arrows.
Hold shift and/or alt as you draw to change the arrow's color.

## Customizing arrow colors

Fancyground uses [web colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors).

**Chrome:** Go to [chrome://extensions] ▶︎ Fancyground Details ▶︎ Extension options  
**Firefox:** Go to [about:addons] ▶︎ Fancyground ▶︎ Preferences

Arrow colors are saved automatically.
